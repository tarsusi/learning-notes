# Closure

MDN defines closure:

> A **closure** is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the **lexical environment**). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function.

Closure is a function that allows you to access to the parent function scope, even though it’s been removed from the execution context stack.
