# Conditionals & Loops

## Switch Statement

- Add **break** after each _case_ statement. Otherwise, when a case statement is completed, the code runs the subsequent _case_ statements immediately.

## For in Loop

- **for in** loop iterates through the keys of objects and also keys in **prototype** of the object.
